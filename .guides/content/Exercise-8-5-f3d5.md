In Scrabble each player has a set of tiles with letters on them, and the object of the game is to use those letters to spell words.  The scoring system is complicated, but as a rough guide longer words are often worth more than shorter words.

Imagine you are given your set of tiles as a String, like `"qijibo"` and you are given another String to test, like `"jib"`.

Write a function called `TestWord()` that takes these two Strings and returns true if the set of tiles can be used to spell the word.  You might have more than one tile with the same letter, but you can only use each tile once.

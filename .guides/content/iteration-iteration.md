One of the things computers are often used for is the automation of repetitive tasks.  Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

In section 4.7 we have seen programs that use **recursion** to perform repetition, such as `PrintLines()` and `Countdown()`.  I now want to introduce a new type of repetition, that is called **iteration**, and C provides several language features that make it easier to write repetetive programs.

The two features we are going to look at are the `while` statement and the `for` statement.

Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common
English words to mean something different from their common
English meaning.  For example, in English, a statement and
a comment are pretty much the same thing, but when we are
talking about a program, they are very different.

The glossary at the end of each chapter is intended to highlight
words and phrases that have special meanings in computer science.
When you see familiar words, don't assume that you know what 
they mean!

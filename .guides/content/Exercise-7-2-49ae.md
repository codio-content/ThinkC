Write a function that takes an array of integers, the length of the array and an integer named `target` as arguments. 

The function should search through the provided array and should return the first index where `target` appears in the array, if it does. If `target` is not in the array the function should  return an invalid index value to indicate an error condition  (e.g.  -1).

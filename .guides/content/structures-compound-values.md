Most of the data types we have been working with represent a single value---an integer, a floating-point number, a character value.  Strings are different in the sense that they are made up of smaller pieces, the characters.  Thus, strings are an example of a **compound** type. 

Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a compound type as a single thing (or object), or we may want to access its parts (or member variables).  This ambiguity is useful.

It is also useful to be able to create your own compound values.   C provides a mechanism for doing that: **structures**.

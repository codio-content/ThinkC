The point of this exercise is to make sure you understand how
to write and invoke functions that take parameters.

1.  Write the first line of a function named `Zool()` that takes three parameters: an `int` and two `char`.

1.  Write a line of code that invokes `Zool()`, passing as arguments the value `11`, the letter `a`, and the letter `z`.

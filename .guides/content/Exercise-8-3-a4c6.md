A word is said to be a `doubloon` if every letter that appears in the word appears exactly twice.  For example, the following are all the doubloons I found in my dictionary.

> Abba, Anna, appall, appearer, appeases, arraigning, beriberi, bilabial, boob, Caucasus, coco, Dada, deed, Emmett, Hannah, horseshoer, intestines, Isis, mama, Mimi, murmur, noon, Otto, papa, peep, reappear, redder, sees, Shanghaiings, Toto

Write a function called `IsDoubloon()` that returns `TRUE` if the given word is a doubloon and `FALSE` otherwise.

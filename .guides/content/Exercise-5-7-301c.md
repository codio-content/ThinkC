The point of this exercise is to practice the syntax of fruitful functions.

* Use your existing solution to Exercise 3.4 and make sure you can still compile and run it.

{Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh gcc code/ex5-3.c -o code/ex5-3 ./code/ex5-3 5 )

*  Transform `Multadd()` into a fruitful function, so that instead of printing a result, it returns it.

* Everywhere in the program that `Multadd()` gets invoked, change the invocation so that it stores the result in a variable and/or prints the result.

* Transform `Yikes()` in the same way.

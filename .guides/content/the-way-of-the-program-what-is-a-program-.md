A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.  The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.


The instructions, which we will call **statements**, look different in different programming languages, but there are a few basic operations most languages can perform:

* **input:** Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.
* **output:** Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
* **math:** Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
* **testing:** Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
* **repetition:** Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. 

That's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of statements that perform these operations.  Thus, one way to describe programming is the process of breaking a large, complex task up into smaller and smaller subtasks until eventually the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic operations.

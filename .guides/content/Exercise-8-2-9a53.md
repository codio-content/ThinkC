Write a function called `LetterHist()` that takes a String as a parameter and that returns a histogram of the letters in the String. The zeroeth element of the histogram should contain the number of a's in the String (upper and lower case); the 25th element should contain the number of z's.

Your solution should only traverse the String once.

The first verse of the song ''99 Bottles of Beer'' is:

>99 bottles of beer on the wall,
>99 bottles of beer,
>ya' take one down, ya' pass it around,
>98 bottles of beer on the wall.

Subsequent verses are identical except that the number
of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the
last verse:

>No bottles of beer on the wall,
>no bottles of beer,
>ya' can't take one down, ya' can't pass it around,
>'cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!

And then the song (finally) ends.

Write a program that prints the entire lyrics of ''99 Bottles of Beer.''  Your program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you also might want to write additional methods to separate the major
functions of the program.

{Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh gcc code/ex4-2.c -o code/ex4-2 ./code/ex4-2)

As you are developing your code, you will probably want to test it with a small number of verses, like ''3 Bottles of Beer.''

The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple, easily-debugged methods.

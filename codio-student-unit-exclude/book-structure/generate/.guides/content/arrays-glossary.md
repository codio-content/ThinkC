* **array:**  A named collection of values, where all the values have the same type, and each value is identified by an index.
* **element:**  One of the values in a array.  The `****` operator selects elements of a array.
* **index:**  An integer variable or value used to indicate an element of a array.
* **increment:**  Increase the value of a variable by one. The increment operator in C is `++`.
* **decrement:**  Decrease the value of a variable by one. The decrement operator in C is `-``-`.
* **deterministic:**  A program that does the same thing every time it is run.
* **pseudorandom:**  A sequence of numbers that appear to be random, but which are actually the product of a deterministic computation.
* **seed:**  A value used to initialize a random number sequence. Using the same seed should yield the same sequence of values.
* **bottom-up design:**  A method of program development that starts by writing small, useful functions and then assembling them into larger solutions.
* **histogram:**  A array of integers where each integer counts the number of values that fall into a certain range.

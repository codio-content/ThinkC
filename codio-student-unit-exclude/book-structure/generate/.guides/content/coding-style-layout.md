Block comments should be used at the top of your file, before all function declarations, to explain the purpose of the program and give additional information.

You should also use a similar documentation style before every  relevant function in your program.
```code

#include <stdlib.h>

/*

int main (void)
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
